## ETH-80 shape dataset

This folder contains a shape dataset consisting of polygonal chains extracted from binary images of everyday objects comprising a famous benchmark dataset for computer vision known as [ETH-80](https://github.com/chenchkx/ETH-80) (n = 3280). As specified by the source, ETH-80 "contains visual object images from 8 different categories including apples, cars, cows,cups, dogs, horses, pears and tomatoes. For each category, there are 10 object instances and 41 images for each object instance captured from different viewpoints".

Polygonal chains are provided in .Rdata format.
